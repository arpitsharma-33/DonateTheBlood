			<p>
				Today, most medical care depends on a steady supply of blood from donors, as one in seven people entering the hospital need blood. For Moffitt, as cancer care increases, so does the demand for blood and platelet donations. An adequate amount of blood is needed in all health care facilities to meet the urgent need for patients facing trauma and other lifesaving procedures, such as blood transfusions – which saves millions of lives each year. Donating blood is a simple procedure that can be done within an hour.

			<p>
				In 2007, researchers looked at the data of over 1 million blood donors. Among the participants, there was a 30%Trusted Source lower chance of dying from any cause and a 4% lower chance of developing cancer. The authors concluded that “blood donors enjoy better than average health.”

A 2015 studyTrusted Source took a fresh look at the same data. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that for each annual donation, a person’s risk of dying from any cause fell by 7.5%, on average.
